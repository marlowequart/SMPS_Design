# SMPS_Design


These are some scripts I have created for power electronics design and analysis.

$$ Motor_Solver_air_gap_flux_density_negharm.py is a script to plot the air gap flux density as a function of theta for a permanent magnet alternator.

$$ ADPLL.py is a script to simulate a phase lock loop implemented in a programmable logic device.

$$ buck_loop_sims.py is a script to simulate the open-loop and closed-loop frequency domain response of a voltage mode controlled buck converter.

$$ buck_fla.py is a script to simulate the time domain analysis of a voltage mode controlled buck converter using finite element analysis.

$$ boost_loop_sims.py is a script to simulate the closed-loop control to output frequency response of a current mode control boost converter including a two stage input filter.
